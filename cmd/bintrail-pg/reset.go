var resetCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "reset",
	Short: "Tear down a PostgreSQL capture: drop the replication slot and clear the index checkpoint",
	Long: `Cleanly tears down a PostgreSQL capture so you can re-baseline and start fresh.

It performs the two-system teardown that otherwise has to be done by hand:

  1. drops the replication slot on the SOURCE (--query-dsn) — a slot left behind
     keeps pinning WAL and can fill the source disk;
  2. clears the durable checkpoint in the INDEX (--index-dsn): the position and
     counter columns of the stream_state row are cleared (the row is never
     DELETEd), so the next 'bintrail-pg stream' starts from a fresh slot.

Continuity: dropping and recreating a slot inherently skips whatever the old
slot had not yet streamed, so discarding a real checkpoint is durably recorded
as a permanent continuity loss (gap_lost_at/gap_lost_detail in stream_state,
naming the discarded LSN) — 'bintrail status' shows the EVENTS PERMANENTLY LOST
banner and 'status --fail-on-gap' exits non-zero. The loss always remains
recorded: a real-checkpoint reset replaces a prior unacknowledged record's
detail with its own; only a no-checkpoint reset preserves a prior record
verbatim. Run reset with the stream stopped.

The slot is dropped first: if the run is interrupted between the two steps, the
safe state is "slot gone, checkpoint stale" (the next stream fails loud) rather
than "checkpoint cleared, slot live" (which would silently skip data).

After a lost-slot invalidation the slot may already be gone or unusable; pass
--index-only to clear just the checkpoint without touching the source.

This is destructive and irreversible — pass --force to confirm. The index's
recovery data is NOT affected (recovery is index-only); only capture-resume state
is removed.

Examples:

  bintrail-pg reset --query-dsn "$PG" --index-dsn "$IDX" --slot bintrail_slot --force
  bintrail-pg reset --index-dsn "$IDX" --index-only --force   # slot already gone`,
	RunE: runPGReset,

//
// It loads the existing row first and branches on whether a real checkpoint (a non-zero
// LSN cursor — saveCheckpointPG never writes 0) is being discarded:
//
//   - real checkpoint: dropping and recreating the slot skips whatever the old slot had
//     not yet streamed past that LSN, so the discard is stamped as a permanent loss IN
//     THE SAME STATEMENT that clears the cursor — one atomic write, which satisfies the
//     safety property PR #1080's MySQL --reset enforces by ordering (stamp before
//     advance): the clear can never become durable without the stamp. A prior
//     unacknowledged record's detail is replaced by the reset detail (#1080 jump
//     semantics); the loss flag itself is never cleared here.
//   - no checkpoint (row seeded by a lost-slot stamp or a pre-commit health snapshot,
//     or an earlier reset): nothing is discarded — clear only the position/counter
//     columns and leave any prior gap_lost_* record untouched (#1080's no-op path).
//     Residual by design: a crash inside the first checkpoint interval can leave
//     indexed events with pos still 0; a reset then discards the surviving slot's
//     un-streamed WAL without a stamp — softened by "re-seed the baseline" being the
//     documented post-reset contract.
//
// The load and the write run in one transaction with the row locked (FOR UPDATE): the
// branch decision is made on the read, and saveCheckpointPG's upsert landing a FIRST
// checkpoint between a bare read and the write would get cleared UN-stamped — the exact
// laundering this function exists to prevent. The lock serializes against every
// stream_state writer and guarantees the row still exists at write time, which is what
// makes the rows:1 report honest (RowsAffected is no substitute: the driver reports
// CHANGED rows, so an identical same-second re-clear would read as 0).
//
// Either way the cleared row reads as first-run to the stream (loadStreamStatePG
// treats a zero-position row as no checkpoint), so a fresh slot is created on the next
// start. tableMissing=true with a nil error means the stream_state table does not
// exist (MySQL 1146) — a never-streamed index, or an --index-dsn pointing at the wrong
