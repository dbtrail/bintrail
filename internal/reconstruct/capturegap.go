// GapDetected in gap.go (baseline-anchor-vs-first-event position gap) and from
// the query planner's coverage-gap check (query.GapError: an hour rotated out
// of MySQL with no archive, which is potentially fillable by re-archiving).

// silently inert on exactly the un-migrated indexes it protects. Under strict
// mode (allowGaps=false, the reconstruct default) this returns an error; under
// --allow-gaps it logs a slog.Warn and returns nil so the caller proceeds with
