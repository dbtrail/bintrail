// observeCommitLag publishes the commit-side availability metrics for a batch
// that has just landed in the index (#1223/#1225). now is T2 — the moment the
// INSERT committed and the batch became queryable and recoverable.
//
// Pure apart from the metric writes and separated from flush() so the decisions
// below are testable without a MySQL round trip; the caller has already
// established that the flush SUCCEEDED.
//
// Three rules the tests pin, each of which is a way this could lie:
//
//   - A zero ReadAt is SKIPPED, never observed as 0. Zero means the event was
//     built by something that does not read replication (file-mode re-index, a
//     synthesized event); recording it would report a re-index of month-old
//     binlogs as a 0-second latency, the most convincing possible "everything
//     is fresh". Per event, so a mixed batch cannot contaminate the histogram.
//   - The availability lag is the batch MAXIMUM, not the last event's: the
//     oldest change in the batch defines the recovery point, and a lag gauge
//     that reports anything better than its worst event is not a safety signal.
//   - LastFlushTimestamp is set for EVERY successful non-empty flush, including
//     one where every ReadAt was zero. It answers "when did this process last
//     make anything queryable", which is exactly the question the other two
//     gauges cannot answer once traffic stops.
