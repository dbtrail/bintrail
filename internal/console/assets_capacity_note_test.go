// means "not measured" must have its own arm in BOTH renderings — the
// console's capacityFreeNote and the CLI's freeUnmeasurableDetail — or that

// There are three consumers and the CLI one was missed for a full review pass,
// which is the same lag this guard exists to stop. `doctor` prints its own
// text; a reason that reaches it with no arm renders the advice-free fallback
// on a terminal where nobody sees the console card that would have explained it.
//
// The declaration pattern is deliberately loose about spacing. The first draft
// required exactly one space, and a constant added WITHOUT a doc comment above
// it was invisible: gofmt pads such a line to align with its neighbour, and the
// guard skipped it while `len(found) < 4` stayed satisfied by the constants
// that were already there. Every existing constant in that block carries a
// comment, so the conventional addition was caught and only the unconventional
// one slipped — the worst shape for a guard, since it is silent exactly when
// the author was not following the pattern this file teaches. `const X ... = `
// on its own line is matched for the same reason: capacity.go uses that form
