// Package telemetry implements bintrail's usage telemetry: a metadata-only,
// spool-based reporter for command mix and error classes.
//
// Two invariants make the privacy claims verifiable from source rather than
// from documentation:
//
//   - The wire payload is a closed allowlist (Event below, AllowedFields).
//     Nothing reaches the network that is not one of those keys.
//   - This package must not import internal/config, internal/parser,
//     internal/indexer, internal/query, internal/recovery, internal/byos or
//     any server-identity package. A package that cannot reach them cannot
//     read a DSN, a row, or a server UUID — a structural guarantee that
//     survives a careless future contributor, which a field allowlist alone
//     does not (an allowlist is blind to where a value came from).
//
// There is no PERSISTENT identifier: nothing that survives the process or
// identifies the install is created, and the only file telemetry writes
// outside the spool is the consent record, which carries no id. RunID is
// generated per process, lives in the spooled event until that batch is
// delivered or aged out (so ingestion can dedup a re-sent file), and never
// appears in a daemon beacon — a months-lived process's run_id would be
// exactly the longitudinal key this design refuses to produce.
